#### Memory Management 
- use malloc, calloc, realloc, free to manage memory.
- Implement data structures ie arrays, linked lists and hash tables to store and organize data.
- Also include efficient traversal of the data structures.

# File I/O
- use fopen, fread, fwrite, fseek etc
# File Organization
- Consider indexed, sequential or heap structures
Buffering:
Implement efficient read/write buffering to improve I/O performance.
#### Algorithms
# Search Algorithms:
- Implement linear search, binary search, and index-based searching for performance optimization.
# Sorting Algorithms:
- Know quicksort, mergesort, and heap sort for sorting records.
# Tree-Based Operations:
- Implement B-trees or B+ trees for balanced, efficient indexing.
# Concurrency Control:
- Learn lock-based or optimistic concurrency algorithms if supporting concurrent transactions.
#### Data Storage and Organization
# Indexing:
- Implement primary and secondary indexes to speed up searches.
# Database Pages:
- Divide the database into pages for block-level data handling.
# Record Management:
- Decide how to store and retrieve individual records effectively.
#### SQL Parser (Optional)
# If implementing an SQL-like query language:
- Study how to tokenize and parse queries using tools like flex and bison.
# Build a query execution engine to translate queries into database operations.
#### Transaction Management
# ACID Properties:
- Understand atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability to ensure reliable database operations.
# Logging and Recovery:
- Implement write-ahead logging (WAL) for crash recovery.
# Concurrency Control:
- Use locking mechanisms like two-phase locking or multiversion concurrency control (MVCC).
#### Networking (For Distributed Databases)
# If planning to build a networked database:
- Learn socket programming to handle client-server communication.
# Implement protocols for data exchange between nodes.
#### Testing and Debugging
# Profiling Tools:
- Use tools like valgrind for memory leak detection.
# Unit Testing:
- Test individual modules of your database to ensure correctness.
# Stress Testing:
- Simulate high load scenarios to ensure scalability.


Suggested Learning Path
Start with basic data structures and algorithms.
Learn file handling and design a simple flat-file database.
Add indexing and query processing features.
Implement transaction support and crash recovery mechanisms.
If needed, add a networking layer for a distributed database.
